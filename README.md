# License Plate Recognition System

This repository contains the code for a License Plate Recognition system, which uses deep learning and optical character recognition (OCR) to identify and process vehicle license plates.

## Initial Setup

- **Essential Python Libraries**: This project relies on PyTorch, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and EasyOCR for the main functionality.
- **GPU Acceleration**: To ensure high performance, the computing environment is optimized for GPU acceleration, enabling faster model training and inference.

## Dataset Preparation

- **Image Transformations and Augmentations**: Real-world conditions are simulated through various image transformations and augmentations to improve the robustness of the model.
- **Image Organization**: Images are organized into state classes using PyTorch's `ImageFolder` to facilitate easy batch processing during model training.

## Model Selection and Training

- **Model Efficiency**: ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2 are selected for their balance between efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks.
- **Fine-tuning**: Pre-trained models are fine-tuned to specialize in license plate state classification, leveraging transfer learning to improve performance.

## Integration with OCR and NLP

- **OCR Implementation**: EasyOCR is used to extract text from license plate images, converting visual information into editable and searchable data.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Post-processing of OCR results is handled using natural language models, which help in interpreting and understanding the textual information extracted from the images.
